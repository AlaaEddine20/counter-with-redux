# Simple counter App to understand better Redux.

## The rules that i followed to implement the App:

- Count can't be lower than 0, if user clicks "Decrement" button, an alert will show up;
- If count is odd change the color to "red", else the color is "black".
- When count is 0 the color is "white".
